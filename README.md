# FLERM: Flip's Terminal (previously "flim" or "flip's vim")

This is how I like my terminal set up. Strongly recommend you keep moving, cause I don't know what the hell I'm doin.

## Installation

1. Do this: `curl -L https://raw.github.com/flipsasser/flerm/master/install.sh | bash -s stable`
2. Profit
